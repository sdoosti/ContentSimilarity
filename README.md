# ContentSimilarity
This repository provides a toolkit for extracting sentence embeddings and calculating content similarity. It includes:

* Embedding Extraction: Scripts to generate high-quality sentence embeddings using popular models such as BERT, Sentence-BERT, and others. These embeddings capture the semantic essence of the sentences, enabling accurate content analysis.

* Content Similarity Calculation: Utilities to compute similarity scores between sentences or documents using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and other metrics. These tools facilitate tasks like duplicate detection, clustering, and recommendation systems.

* Example Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of the embedding extraction and similarity calculation tools with step-by-step instructions and sample datasets.
